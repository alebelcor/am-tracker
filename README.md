[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/alebelcor/am-tracker/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/alebelcor/am-tracker)

## Install

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 6+ installed.

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the folder and run: [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)

An npm package is intentionally not provided.

## Usage

Set up `AM_TRACKER_USER_AGENT` environmental variable with your user agent.

```bash
$ am-tracker <options>
```

The search is made for one adult.

### Notifications

Notifications are sent, via Twilio as SMSs, when a desired deal price has been met.

To enable notifications setup these environmental variables with your Twilio account details:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
TWILIO_PHONE_FROM
TWILIO_PHONE_TO
```

### Examples

Scenario A: Track any roundtrip flight (1 adult) from `TIJ` to `MEX` leaving `2017-08-07` and returning `2017-08-14` with a desired deal price total of `5000 MXN` (or less), polling every `60` minutes.

```bash
$ am-tracker \
  --deal-price=5000 \
  --from=TIJ \
  --to=MEX \
  --departure=2017-08-07 \
  --return=2017-08-14 \
  --interval=60
```

Scenario B: Track any one-way flight (1 adult) from `MEX` to `CUN` leaving `2017-08-07` and returning `2017-08-14` with a desired deal price total of `7000 MXN` (or less), polling every `30` minutes.

```bash
$ am-tracker \
  --deal-price=7000 \
  --from=MEX \
  --to=CUN \
  --departure=2017-08-07
```
